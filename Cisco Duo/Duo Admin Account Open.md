# 🔐 Cisco Duo Account Creation Guide

## 📌 What is Cisco Duo MFA?
> ### Cisco Duo is a cloud-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust security platform that protects user logins by requiring more than just a username and password.

Instead of relying on single-factor authentication, Duo enforces:

* Something you know (password)
* Something you have (mobile phone, hardware token)

This prevents attackers from accessing systems even if credentials are stolen via:

* Phishing
* Malware
